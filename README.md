# README
This is the source code for my personal website.
I love the idea of things being open source where people can poke and prod at other's work,
which is why I put all my files up here on GitHub, instead of just pushing changes to a repo on my webserver.

## Contributing
You can contribute to my work in a number of different ways. Sending me feedback, constructive critisism, pull requests, I want it all!
I love learning new things, if you have any contributions you feel you could make, don't hesitate to send them my way!

## Setup
1. Setup couldn't be more simple, as my project is by no means complex.

		cd /example/directory
		git clone git@github.com:VoxelDavid/voxeldavid.git

2. And you're done! It's that easy.
