## Stay Tuned

This is the source code for my personal website, [davidminnerly.com](http://davidminnerly.com). I'm currently in the process of transitioning from my [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com) site ([release 4.3.0](https://github.com/VoxelDavid/voxeldavid-website/releases/tag/v4.3.0)). It's going to be a little while before I have anything presentable.

## Contributing

First things first, make sure you have [Node/NPM](http://nodejs.org) and [Bower](http://bower.io) installed, and then gather all of the dependencies.

```bash
$ npm install
$ bower install
```

Now you're all set to build the project. You can pass `--no-serve` as an argument to prevent the webserver from starting.

```bash
$ node build.js [--no-serve]
```
