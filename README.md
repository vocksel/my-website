This is the source code for my personal website!

I love the idea of things being open source where people can poke and prod at
others work, which is why I put all my files up here on GitHub instead of just
pushing changes to a repo on my webserver.

I encourage you to take a look through everything and send me pull requests if
you find something that could use improving.

All you need is Ruby and Ruby Gems installed so you can download and run
[Bundler](http://gembundler.com) to get all the necessary gems for working on
the project.

Cheers. :)
