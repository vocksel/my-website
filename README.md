## We'll Be Right Back

I'm currently in the process of transitioning from my [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com) site ([release 4.3.0](https://github.com/VoxelDavid/voxeldavid-website/releases/tag/v4.3.0)).

It's going to be a little while before I have anything presentable. I'm still experimenting with [Metalsmith](http://metalsmith.io), and I need to decide on which template engine I want to use (a toss up between Handlebars and Jade).
