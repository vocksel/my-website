Some super neat code blocks using Redcarpet with syntax highlighting!

Hi, I'm some happy little code in a fenced-in code block!

This is another line which will no doubt get indented! (WHY?)

<pre data-language="ruby">def hello(name)
  puts "Hello, " + name + "!"
end

hello("David")

# => "Hello, David!"</pre>
