# Testing New Styles

I've learned 3 things from life:

- Dogs are the best people
- Manatees are worshipped as Gods in some parts of Russia
- There is a secret US Government facility in North Korea

> Archimedes is a firm proponent of the metric system. Unfortunately, he doesn’t find the humor in his recent essay titled, &ldquo;Metric is 10 Times Better than the Imperial System.&rdquo;

'You can't think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!' said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice's, and they walked off together.

Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so savage when they met in the kitchen.

'When I'M a Duchess,' she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful tone though), 'I won't have any pepper in my kitchen AT ALL. Soup does very well without—Maybe it's always pepper that makes people hot-tempered,' she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule, 'and vinegar that makes them sour—and camomile that makes them bitter—and—and barley-sugar and such things that make children sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew that: then they wouldn't be so stingy about it, you know—'

She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. 'You're thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can't tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in a bit.'

'Perhaps it hasn't one,' Alice ventured to remark.

'Tut, tut, child!' said the Duchess. 'Everything's got a moral, if only  you can find it.' And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice's side as she spoke.

<pre data-language='ruby'>
def hello(name)
  puts "Hello, " + name + "!"
end

hello("David") # => "Hello, David!"</pre>

Will print "Hello, David!" to the console.
