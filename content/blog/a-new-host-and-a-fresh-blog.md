title      : "A New Host and A Fresh Blog"
---

My website is now hosted on [VPSCheap](https://vpscheap.net)*. I'm loving all of the
freedom and control I have over my environment. Some stuff is hard to figure
out but it's a really great learning experience. I'm never going back to
Shared hosting.

Now, as it turns out, my database on my old webserver was reset. I don't know
if it was my fault or not, but all of my posts are gone and I don't have any
recent backups.

I had a feeling this would happen eventually hosting my blog on my own site,
but that's okay. They were just posts and I can make more. Now I'm going to
be a bit more careful and make backups so this doesn't happen again.

*EDIT: I've moved again, this time to [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com)
They've got tons of tutorials and a much nicer control panel, everything else
is the same, but I felt it was worth an extra $3 a month. If you're interested,
try the promo codes SSDTWEET and SSDPOWER when purchasing for a $10 credit
(Your mileage may vary, codes should be working as of May 11th, 2013).
