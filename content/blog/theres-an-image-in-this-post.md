Testing out images in blog posts, works a lot easier than I expected!

All I needed was a little CSS to make it behave properly.

And here's another picture to test the sizing:

<!-- This time using the regular image tag! -->
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/HS1xZbJ.jpg" alt="Cat mid-sneeze" width="300">

Doesn't strech! Perfect! And I just learned I can change the Width of an image
and not the height so it keeps it's original aspect ratio!
