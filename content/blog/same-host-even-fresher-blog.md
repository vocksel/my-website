About a week or so ago I was doing some searching for a framework I
could make use of to keep my site organized. During my search I came
across this nifty little thing called [Nanoc](http://nanoc.ws/).

Nanoc is a Static Site Generator that uses the Ruby programming
language to make magic happen. It can really be as simple or as
complex as you want, right out of the box you can just plop in your
website files, modify the Rules, compile it and you're good to go.

I think Nanoc is super cool and I'll definitely be using it in my
projects, atleast until I find something better. I just hope that's
not for a while -- I just got all of this setup!

In any case, this isn't a review about Nanoc, but it *is* an
announcement that I've moved my current website over to it and I
created this Blog so I could be completely independant of WordPress.

Nothing against WordPress of course, it really is a great peice of
software, it's just not for me. All I need is a simple way to put up
posts (with the complete freedom to customize it to my liking and
learn some Ruby along the way) and Nanoc provides just that to me.

That's the end of this blog post, a tad lengthy but I had a lot on my
mind. I hope I have something cool to talk about again soon, blogging
is super fun!

Thanks for reading!
