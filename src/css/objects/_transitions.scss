/**
 * Used in conjunction with other classes to apply transitions to elements.
 *
 * Transitions are abstracted here to make them reusable, instead of setting
 * `transition` directly in classes.
 *
 * This allows for a really neat effect where you can apply a transition class
 * and then toggle other classes on the same element.
 *
 * Toggling the other classes causes them to transition without having to define
 * two seperate `transition` properties in each class.
