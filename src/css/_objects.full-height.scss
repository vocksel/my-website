/**
 * Used to set a background image that covers the height of the browser window.
 *
 * This allows you to have a full-screen background while still having content
 * below the image.
 *
 * For this to work properly it must be applied on all of the elements down a
 * chain.
 *
 * Say you have the following markup:

   <html>
     <body>
       <div class="masthead">
       </div>
     </body>
   </html>

 * You would need to apply the class on all three of these elements.
