/**
 * Refrain from using the same background color twice in a row. Because of the
 * padding, two sections that share the same color have a lot of noticable
 * whitespace between them.
 *
 * Note: A class of .mb0 (margin-bottom: 0) must be applied to the last
 * element in a section.
 *
 * <section id="about">
 *   <div class="wrapper">
 *     <p>Sample content</p>
 *
 *     <p class="mb0">More sample content</p>
 *   </div>
 * </section>
 *
 * Without that class you effectively have double the whitespace at the bottom,
 * because both the margin-bottom on paragraphs and the padding-bottom on
 * sections combine.
