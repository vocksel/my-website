        Echo Ridge</a> is a 3D recreation of the hub level in Mega Man Star
        Force 3. I built it over the span of 3 months, and it has quickly become
        my favorite Roblox project to date.</p>

      <p>I made the first version of Echo Ridge when I was 14, back in October
        of 2010. Almost 4 and a half years later, I took another look at it and
        felt it didn't do the original game justice.</p>

      <p>Thanks to Roblox's modeling system I was able to achieve a much higher
        level of detail. This also opened up the possibility to remove all of
        the seam lines, giving the map a much cleaner appearance.</p>
