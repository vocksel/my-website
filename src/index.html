        <p>I'm a 19-year-old programming enthusiast living in the state of New
          York. I aim to make a career out of server administration and network
          security, and in my spare time I create websites and command-line
          tools.</p>

        <p>I frequently work on open-source projects. All of which can be found
          on my <a href="https://github.com/voxeldavid">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <section id="experience" class="wrapper--content">
        <p>I got my first taste of programming when I was 13. I started out by
          learning Lua on the online building game
          <a href="http://roblox.com">ROBLOX</a>. Making my little blocky
          creations come to life was amazing to me, and it became the foundation
          for something more.</p>

        <p>Since then I've branched out to learning about web design, picking up
          on HTML, CSS and JavaScript along the way. I've experimented with
          creating applications on <a href="https://angularjs.org">AngularJS</a>
          and <a href="https://djangoproject.org">Django</a>, and both of them
          were great fun to work with.</p>

        <p><a href="http://fireflies.davidminnerly.com/">Fireflies</a>: a
          small application that displays a quote and background image at
          random every time the page is loaded.</p>

        <figure class="photo">
          <a class="photo__link" href="http://fireflies.davidminnerly.com/"
             title="Check out Fireflies in person">
            <img class="photo__image" src="/img/projects/fireflies.png">
          </a>

        <p>It started as an <a href="https://angularjs.org">AngularJS</a> app.
          It fit my needs very well at the start, but a major drawback to my
          setup was that new images and quotes were cumbersome to implement.</p>

        <p>I later fixed this by porting Fireflies to
          <a href="https://djangoproject.org">Django</a>. This works
          considerably better, as now when I want to add a new image or quote, I
          can do it directly from the admin interface.</p>

        <p>All of the images and quotes mean a lot to me, I picked ones that I
          personally liked, and because of that I hold Fireflies very near to my
          heart.</p>
