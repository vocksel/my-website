      <p>I'm a 20-year-old programming enthusiast living in the state of New
        York. I aim to make a career out of server administration and network
        security, and in my spare time I create websites and computer
        programs.</p>

      <p>I frequently work on open-source projects. All of which can be found
        on my <a href="https://github.com/voxeldavid">GitHub</a>.</p>

    <section id="experience" class="wrapper--content">
      <p>I got my first taste of programming when I was 13. I started out by
        learning Lua on the online building game
        <a href="http://roblox.com">ROBLOX</a>. Making my little blocky
        creations come to life was amazing to me, and it became the foundation
        for something more.</p>

      <p>Since then I've branched out to learning about web design, picking up
        on HTML, CSS and JavaScript along the way. I've experimented with
        creating applications on <a href="https://angularjs.org">AngularJS</a>
        and <a href="https://djangoproject.org">Django</a>, and both of them
        were great fun to work with.</p>

    <section id="fireflies" class="wrapper--content">
      <h1 class="side-lines">Fireflies</h1>

      <p><a href="http://fireflies.davidminnerly.com/">Fireflies</a> is a
        small application that displays a quote and background image at
        random every time the page is loaded.</p>

      <figure class="photo">
        <a class="photo__link" href="http://fireflies.davidminnerly.com/"
           title="Check out Fireflies in person">
          <img class="photo__image  js-color-scroll  grayscale"
               src="/img/projects/fireflies.png">
        </a>

        <figcaption class="photo__caption">

      <p>It started as an <a href="https://angularjs.org">AngularJS</a> app.
        It fit my needs very well at the start, but a major drawback to my
        setup was that new images and quotes were cumbersome to implement.</p>

      <p>I later fixed this by porting Fireflies to
        <a href="https://djangoproject.org">Django</a>. This works
        considerably better, as now when I want to add a new image or quote, I
        can do it directly from the admin interface.</p>

      <p>All of the backgrounds and quotes mean a lot to me, I picked ones
        that I personally liked, and because of that I hold Fireflies very
        near to my heart.</p>

        <p><a href="http://www.roblox.com/games/13525723/view?rbxp=1343930">
          Echo Ridge</a> is a 3D recreation of the hub level in Mega Man Star
          Force 3. I built it over the span of 3 months, and it has quickly
          become my favorite ROBLOX project to date.</p>
      </header>

      <figure class="photo">
        <a class="photo__link" href="http://www.roblox.com/games/13525723/view?rbxp=1343930">
          <img class="photo__image  js-color-scroll  grayscale"
               src="/img/projects/echo-ridge.png">
        </a>

        <figcaption class="photo__caption">

        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>I made the first version of Echo Ridge when I was 14, back in October
        of 2010. Almost 4 and a half years later, I took another look at it
        and felt it didn't do the original game justice.</p>

      <p>Thanks to ROBLOX's modeling system I was able to achieve a much
        higher level of detail. This also opened up the possibility to remove
        all of the seam lines, giving the map a much cleaner appearance.</p>

      <figure class="photo">
        <a class="photo__link" href="http://www.roblox.com/games/13525723/view?rbxp=1343930">

      </figure>

      <p>This new version is a much better representation of Echo Ridge, and
        it's an excellent example of the difference 4 years of experience can
        make. It is one of my most detailed projects on ROBLOX, and overall
        I'm very happy with how it turned out.</p>
