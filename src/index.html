        <p>I'm a 19-year-old programming enthusiast living in the state of New
          York. I aim to make a career out of server administration and network
          security, and in my spare time I create websites and command-line
          tools.</p>

        <p>I frequently work on open-source projects. All of which can be found
          on my <a href="https://github.com/voxeldavid">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <section id="extended-about" class="text-content">
        <p>I got my first taste of programming when I was 13. I started out by
          learning Lua on the online building game
          <a href="http://roblox.com">ROBLOX</a>. Making my little blocky
          creations come to life was amazing to me, and it became the foundation
          for something more.</p>

        <p>Since then I've branched out to learning about web design, picking up
          on HTML, CSS and JavaScript along the way. I've experimented with
          creating applications on <a href="https://angularjs.org">AngularJS</a>
          and <a href="https://djangoproject.org">Django</a>, and both of them
          were great fun to work with.</p>

        <p>I love learning new programming languages, they give me valuable
          insight into different methods of creating programs. This goes hand-
          in-hand with my ability to solve problems. The more ways I know how to
          go about something, the better I can solve it.</p>
