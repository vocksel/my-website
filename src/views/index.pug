    p I'm a #{site.age}-year-old programming enthusiast living in the state of New York. I aim to make a career out of server administration and network security, and in my spare time I create websites and computer programs.

    p I frequently work on open-source projects. All of which can be found on my #[a(href="https://github.com/voxeldavid/") GitHub].

  +section("experience")
    p I got my first taste of programming when I was 13. I started out by learning Lua on the online building game #[a(href="http://roblox.com") ROBLOX]. Making my little blocky creations come to life was amazing to me, and it became the foundation for something more.

    p Since then I've branched out to learning about web design, picking up on HTML, CSS and JavaScript along the way. I've experimented with creating applications on #[a(href="https://angularjs.org") AngularJS] and #[a(href="https://djangoproject.org") Django], and both of them were great fun to work with.

    p #[a(href="http://www.roblox.com/games/13525723/view?rbxp=1343930") Echo Ridge] is a 3D recreation of the hub level in Mega Man Star Force 3. I built it over the span of 3 months, and it has quickly become my favorite ROBLOX project to date.

    p I made the first version of Echo Ridge when I was 14, back in October of 2010. Almost 4 and a half years later, I took another look at it and felt it didn't do the original game justice.

    p Thanks to ROBLOX's modeling system I was able to achieve a much higher level of detail. This also opened up the possibility to remove all of the seam lines, giving the map a much cleaner appearance.

    p This new version is a much better representation of Echo Ridge, and it's an excellent example of the difference 4 years of experience can make. It is one of my most detailed projects on ROBLOX, and overall I'm very happy with how it turned out.

    p #[a(href="http://fireflies.davidminnerly.com") Fireflies] is a small application that displays a quote and background image at random every time the page is loaded.

      | A screenshot of Fireflies in action.

    p It started as an #[a(href="https://angularjs.org") AngularJS] app. It fit my needs very well at the start, but a major drawback to my setup was that new images and quotes were cumbersome to implement.

    p I later fixed this by porting Fireflies to #[a(href="https://djangoproject.org") Django]. This works considerably better, as now when I want to add a new image or quote, I can do it directly from the admin interface.

      | Another screenshot of Fireflies, with a different quote and background.

    p All of the backgrounds and quotes mean a lot to me, I picked ones that I personally liked, and because of that I hold Fireflies very near to my heart.
