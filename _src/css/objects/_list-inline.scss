/**
 * The list-inline object simply displays a list of items in one line.
 *
 * Completely ripped off from: https://github.com/inuitcss/objects.list-inline
 *
 * I just needed a simple implementation and decided the configuration was a bit
 * too much to get the desired outcome.
 *
 * The main issue was not knowing where to actually configure the variables, and
 * then how to extend it to add the padding.
